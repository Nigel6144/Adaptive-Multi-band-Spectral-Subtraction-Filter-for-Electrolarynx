# Adaptive-Multi-band-Spectral-Subtraction-Filter-for-Electrolarynx
An electrolarynx speech enhancement system that uses minimum-statistics–based adaptive noise estimation and multi-frequency-band spectral subtraction. Each band is processed with tailored subtraction factors to reduce background noise and buzzing while preserving key human speech characteristics and improving intelligibility.
